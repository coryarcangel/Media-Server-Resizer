A Photoshop application or "droplet", that allows you to drag and drop onto it to resize, rename, and export images according to the studio's filing guidelines.

To install:

1. Place arcangel-studio-image-resizer.jsx in this folder:
 Mac:
 /Applications/**Current version of photoshop**/Presets/Scripts
 PC:
 /Program Files/Adobe/Photoshop **Current version of photoshop**/Presets/Scripts

2. Open any image in Photoshop.Under Window -> Actions, click the + button to create a new action and name it "Run Resizer"

3. Begin recording the action, and go to File -> Scripts -> Browse.
Find arcangel-studio-image-resizer.jsx in the Scripts folder from step 1 and load it.

4. When the Resizer window opens, click return key.
This should close the current file in photoshop.

5. Go back to Window -> Actions, and click the stop button to save the action.

6. Make the droplet with the new action by going to File-> Automate -> Create Droplet.
Choose to save it to the Desktop, and pick "Run Resizer" from the dropdown menu.

7.That's it! Click ok! ;-)

Drop images onto this file to resize them to db and press images.
